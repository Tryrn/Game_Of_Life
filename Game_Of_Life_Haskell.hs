{-
When main is run it takes an input for a file, that game of life is then run using the life function. 

I have taken basis in the code for game of life in the course's book
(Graham Hutton - Programming in Haskell second edition, page 133).
I had to change most of the code to fit the assignment. 

I was not able to finish the code for the visualizer, you can see what I was working on at the bottom.
In place is a very simple visualizer (showcells), used in the book. 
Everything else should be answered to some extent

The type Game is used allot;
Game is a tuple with Pos and [Int], Pos is a list of positions of the alive cells, while [Int] is a list for the settings of the game. 
For a overview of [Int]'s setting propoerties, see the comment above initializeSettings

For reading files i use a tokenizer and a self-defined parser (starting with initialize1). 

The function life is where the game itself is run.
This is where the user can interact with the game via inputs.

# Game_Of_Life

A fleshed out game of life in Haskell.
	
This was the final compulsory assignment I had in the course functional programming (INF122) at the University of Bergen. 

If you do not know what The Game of Life is, here is a quick summary of the rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules

The assignment itself can be found as a pdf file in the repository. For a full overview of all the details, I suggest checking it out. 

The Assignment can be summed up in four points:

1: Terminal commands for editing and progressing the current game.

2: Visualising the game's board and displaying results of various commands. 

3: Reading files and format that specify a game.

4: Specifying an infinite glider following specified game rules. 

This assignment shows general competence for Haskell aswell as competence for tokenizing, parcing, the IO (), file formating and recursion.
